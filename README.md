I'm currently learning Web-Development and this is my first Github Project.
This is a Website with some fun recipes to try!
It will have a Main Site linked to different pages, each with one recipe.

## Skills:
This Project will demonstrate the following skills, i have previously learned from The Odin Project:
### HTML:
-Elements and Tags
-Basic HTML structure / HTML boilerplate
-Working with text (Paragraphs, headings, bold text, etc.)
-Ordered and unordered Lists
